# Modelling-Epidemic-Spread-in-a-Dynamical-Network
Third-year project concerned with understanding how network structure can affect the outcome of SIR (and SIRS) epidemic simulations.

## Summary

## Project Details
> Please see PDF file for additional details.

### Network Initialisation
- Generated a probabilistic, non-static network using the EpiModel package for RStudio with default parameter values based on existing research
- Defined key terms and concepts with appropriate explanation

### Sensitivity Analysis
- Ran 100s of simulations measuring the effects of varying network parameters (2D sensitivity analysis)
- Summarised findings with reference to real-world application

### Extending the Model
- Incorporated an additional susceptible state thus extending our SIR model to SIRS and enhancing model complexity
- Accounted for time-sensitive events using an `updater` function
- Attempted to model evolution of infection disease using a `progress` function
